## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created this prework study guide application because I want an application that I can continually update to refresh myself on the knowledge I was taught in my UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. This project will help me reinforce learning material so that any time I need a refresher or add any hard to understand info as reference in case I get stuck or confused in the future. This project taught me not only a fun way to take notes or help reinforce taught topics, but also this helps reinforce Git version control and Github knowledge as well!
